# BudGets
Budget Planner 

Introduction
  Financial difficulties have been one of the issues that most of us are experiencing, specially students. Low financial resources, a high cost of living and a failure to keep track of their expenses are some of the reasons why it is happening and why they are having a hard time setting financial priorities. These lack of financial awareness leads students in shortage of budget for the intend time. It results to cut some necessities on the list, some even endure hunger to skip meals, late payment on school requirements and no more money to spend for the next days.
